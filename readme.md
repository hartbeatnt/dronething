### Commit Messages

Commit messages should begin with a verb describing what the commit does, if pulled in: e.g. `Installs react & react-redux as project dependencies`

As a rule of thumb, commit often and keep your commits short and concise.

When committing, prefix your commits with `:EMOJI_NAME:` to categorize your commit. Here are the list of emojis and their respective categories:

:wrench: : `:wrench:` – installing tooling  
:hammer: : `:hammer:` – in-progress feature  
:books: : `:books:` – documentation or code comments  
:lipstick: : `:lipstick:` – front-end styling  
:bug: : `:bug:` – bugfix  
:sparkles: : `:sparkles:` – new feature (mostly applicable to pull requests and not individual commits)
